# ECG Preprocessing Module Documentation

## Overview
The preprocessing module handles ECG signal enhancement, noise reduction, and standardization for medical-grade ECG analysis.

## Current Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

### What Preprocessing Does:
- **Signal Cleaning**: Remove noise, artifacts, baseline drift
- **Standardization**: Normalize ECG signals across different devices
- **Enhancement**: Improve signal quality for AI analysis
- **Calibration**: Ensure consistent measurements

### Why We Need Preprocessing:

1. **Real-World ECG Challenges**:
   - Device-specific noise patterns
   - Baseline drift from patient movement
   - Power line interference (50/60 Hz)
   - Muscle artifacts from patient tension

2. **Clinical Data Variability**:
   - Different ECG machines (Schiller, GE, Philips)
   - Varying sampling rates (100Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz)
   - Different lead configurations
   - Patient-specific factors (age, body size)

3. **AI Model Performance**:
   - Clean signals â†’ better accuracy
   - Consistent preprocessing â†’ reliable predictions
   - Standardized inputs â†’ robust model performance

## Current Implementation Status:
